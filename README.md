# gportal-ark-scraper

Reason:
I was tired of allways sending the server IP and port to our players in the ark cluster if gportal changed again a server ip. I understand  that they have to do this sometimes but for all tools that I use in the background (character search, ftp backup scripts and server stats) I had to change the config every time. Here comse  this node app in play. It scraps the data from gportal and I can write then my configs for my scripts. Thats all =)
